# Release notes

## 14/5/2026

- **8:7 aspect ratio scaling** added as a new screen mode option, giving a more authentic CRT pixel shape alongside the existing 1:1 mode.
- **Configurable scanline type** (HSTX boards): choose between *Simple* (darken odd lines) and *LCD* (darken every other output column) in the settings menu.
- **FDS auto-insert disk setting**: new *Auto Insert Disk A* option (default On). When set to Off, the disk starts ejected so the player can press A to insert it manually, showing the BIOS animation.
- **Software version** now displayed on the splash screen.
- **Settings menu improvements**:
  - Refactored layout with dedicated SAVE / CANCEL / DEFAULT action row.
  - FDS menu labels cleaned up for consistency and clarity.
  - Fixed save label formatting.
  - Fixed settings showing unsaved changes due to struct padding bytes (now uses `memcpy` for comparison-safe copies).
  - Settings are now correctly persisted on game reset.
  - Settings version bumped to 111.
- **Memory / stability fixes**:
  - Fixed double memory allocation for the HSTX DI ring buffer in `hstx_di_queue_init`.
  - Fixed use-after-free bug in the settings menu.
  - Enhanced memory allocation logging to include function context.
- **Other**:
  - Splash screen text colors updated to use default foreground and background colors.
  - Refactored `menuPumpBlankFrames` for RP2040 to feed black scanlines for display sync without requiring screenBuffer allocation.

## 2/5/2026

- **Emulator Specific**:
  - NES: Added support for FDS disk switching in settings menu.

- **Menu navigation fixes**:
  - Fixed menu selection refresh when navigating folders and files.
  - Improved handling of `selectedRomOrFolder` state during menu navigation changes.

- **Settings initialization fix**:
  - Fixed premature settings loading in `initSettings()` before SD driver is ready. Settings are now loaded only after the SD card is initialized.

## 25/4/2025

- **New `pico_hdmi` HSTX driver** by [@fliperama86](https://github.com/fliperama86/pico_hdmi) replaces the in-tree HSTX driver used previously.
  - Several RP2350 board configurations switched from the PicoDVI driver to HSTX: HW_CONFIG 2 (Breadboard / PCB Pico/Pico 2) and HW_CONFIG 5 (Adafruit Metro RP2350). Adafruit Fruit Jam and Murmulator M2 also use the new driver.
  - `pico_hdmi` is embedded as a Git submodule; include path fixed in `CMakeLists.txt`.
  - `HSTX` definition now guarded by `PICO_RP2350` to keep RP2040 builds clean.

- **HDMI audio over HSTX**.
  - HSTX output now embeds audio in the HDMI stream (previously HSTX was video-only on this codebase).
  - Pre-encoded silence packets are emitted when no game audio is playing, keeping the audio clock alive.
  - Sample-rate setup moved into `hstx.c`; `hstx_init()` gained a `dviOnly` parameter so the same driver can be configured for full HDMI or DVI-only signaling.
  - WAV player audio path refactored to handle both DVI (no embedded audio) and HSTX (embedded audio) configurations.
  - `di_ring_buffer` offloaded to PSRAM where available to free SRAM.

- **DVI / HDMI display-mode setting** added to the settings menu (`SETTINGS_VERSION` bumped to 107).
  - On boards that support both, users can pick full HDMI (with embedded audio) or DVI-only (video only). Some monitors prefer the DVI signaling.
  - `SELECT + A` shortcut switches to DVI-only at runtime for quick troubleshooting.
  - New `ENABLEDVI` build flag (in `FrensHelpers.h` / `BoardConfigs.cmake`) controls whether the toggle is exposed per hardware configuration.
  - Display-mode initialisation fixed when external audio is enabled at boot.

- **HSTX picture-loss watchdog** (`video_output.c`).
  - Two cooperating watchdogs detect a wedged DMA chain: a stuck-frame check (no new frame for ~500 ms) and an over-rate check (>75 fps measured in a 1 Hz sliding window — observed ~158 Hz drift in DVI mode).
  - Recovery calls `hstx_resync()` to rebuild the DMA chain in place — no reboot needed.
  - A soft HSTX CSR-toggle recovery was tested and removed; only a full resync reliably clears the wedge.
  - Manual resync is also triggered when the settings menu is opened.
  - Extensive diagnostics available behind `HSTX_DEBUG`: frame/IRQ rates, `clk_sys`/`clk_hstx` values, HSTX CSR, ping/pong DMA control words, PLL state, and frequency-counter readings.
  - DMA resync now correctly clears and restores the channel enable bits during abort.

- **Frame pacing / VSync rework**.
  - New `hstx_paceFrame()` implements slack-aware frame pacing for steady 60 fps output.
  - `hstx_waitForVSync()` switched from polling to a frame-counter–driven wait.
  - Menu code refactored to use VSync-based pacing for smoother scrolling; pacing state is reset on menu exit so the emulator returns to normal timing.

- **Headphone jack detection** (Adafruit Fruit Jam):
  - New `Frens::pollHeadPhoneJack()` returns a connection-status enum.
  - Polling is gated by `EXT_AUDIO_IS_ENABLED` so it only runs on boards that actually have a jack.
  - Removed the Fruit Jam internal-speaker mute setting and the Button 1 mute shortcut — superseded by automatic detection.

- **Settings / in-game menu additions**:
  - **Reset game** option in the settings menu, restarts the running game without a reboot.
  - **BOOTSEL mode** option in the settings menu, for flashing firmware without unplugging the device.
  - HDMI/DVI label rendering logic refactored to reflect the active display mode.

- **Other**:
  - Directory and file sorting in the menu switched from `std::sort` to `std::stable_sort` for predictable ordering of equal keys.
  - UART output enabled in `BoardConfigs.cmake` for the RP2040/RP2350-Zero PCB builds.
  - Added a clarifying comment for `FLASHPARAM_MAX_FREQ_KHZ` referencing the conditions under which higher flash frequencies can produce screen artifacts.
  - Fixed a typo in the Adafruit Metro RP2350 board configuration.

## 16/10/2025

- Added support for [Retro-Bit Genesis/Megadrive 8 button Arcade Pad with USB](https://www.retro-bit.com/controllers/genesis/#usb).
- Added possibility to load overlays
- Settings:
  - Version number added. When the version in settings.dat does not match, settings will be reset to defaults.
  - Border/Bezel settings are now saved.

## 20/9/2025

- Waveshare RP2350-USBA support
- Spotpear HDMI support
- Several fixes and improvements needed for smsPlus and GenesisPlus

## 12/9/2025

- Improved I2S audio quality.
- RP2040 only: Release I2S audio resources when entering the menu to free up memory. This fixes out-of memory panics.

## 3/9/2025

- Adafruit Fruit Jam:
  - NeoPixel leds act as a VU meter. Can be toggled on or of via Button2 on the Fruit Jam, or SELECT + RIGHT on the controller.

- Screensaver
  - Block screensaver, which is shown when no metadata is available, is replaced by static floating image.

## 26/8/2025


- Added support for [Adafruit Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200):  
  - Uses HSTX for video output.  
  - Audio is not supported over HSTX — connect speakers via the **audio jack** or the **4–8 Ω speaker connector**.  
  - Audio is simultaneousy played through speaker and jack. Speaker audio can be muted with **Button 1**.  
  - Controller options:  
    - **USB gamepad** on USB 1.  
    - **Wii Classic controller** via [Adafruit Wii Nunchuck Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4836) on the STEMMA QT port.  
  - Two-player mode:  
    - Player 1: USB gamepad (USB 1).  
    - Player 2: Wii Classic controller.  
    - Dual USB (USB 1 + USB 2) multiplayer is **not yet supported**.  
  - Scanlines can be toggled with **SELECT + UP**.  

- Added support for [Waveshare RP2350-PiZero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-pizero.htm):  
  - Gamepad must be connected via the **PIO USB port**.  
  - The built-in USB port is now dedicated to **power and firmware flashing**, removing the need for a USB-Y cable.  
  - Optional: when you solder the optional PSRAM chip on the board, the emulator will make use of it. Roms will be loaded much faster using PSRAM.

- **RP2350 Only** Framebuffer implemented in SRAM. This eliminates the red flicker during slow operations, such as SD card I/O.

- **Cover art and metadata support**:  
  - Download pack [here](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/releases/latest/download/PicoNesMetadata.zip).  
  - Extract the zip contents to the **root of the SD card**.  
  - In the menu:  
    - Highlight a game and press **START** → show cover art and metadata.  
    - Press **SELECT** → show full game description.  
    - Press **B** → return to menu.  
    - Press **START** or **A** → start the game.  

>[!NOTE]
> Cover art and metadata is available for most official released games.

- **Screensaver update**: when cover art is installed, the screensaver displays **floating random cover art** from the SD card.  
- Updated to **Pico SDK 2.2.0**  
- Updated to **lwmem V2.2.3**

## fixes

- Fixed a compiler error in pico_lib using SDK 2.2.2  [#129](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/129)
- Moved the NES controller port 1 PIO from PIO0 to PIO1. This resolves an issue where polling the NES controller would hang in case HDMI (also driven by PIO0) uses GPIO pin numbers 32 and higher, resulting in no image.
- **RP2350 Only** Red screen flicker issue fixed. This was caused by slow operations such as SDcard I/O, which prevented the screen getting updated in time. 


## 18/7/2025
- Fix crash in my_chdir that on RP2040 boards. 

## 12/7/2025

- Make PIO USB only available for RP2350, because of memory limitations on RP2040.
- Move PIO USB to Pio2, this fixes the NES controller not working on controller port 2.

## 6/7/2025

- If PSRAM is present (default pin 47), ROMs load from the SD card into PSRAM instead of flash (RP2350 boards only). This speeds up loading because the board no longer has to reboot to copy the ROM from the SD card to flash. Based on https://github.com/AndrewCapon/PicoPlusPsram
- Added -s option to bld.sh to allow an alternative GPIO pin for PSRAM chip select.
- Added support for Pimoroni Pico Plus 2. (Use hardware configuration 2, which is also used for breadboard and PCB). No extra binary needed.

## 5/7/2025

- Enabled PIO-USB for certain board configurations.
- Refactored bld.sh

## 7/6/2025

- Enable I2S audio on the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base. This allows audio output through external speakers connected to the line-out jack of the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base. 
- improved error handling in build scripts.

## 20/5/2025
- Added Custom PCB design for use with Waveshare [RP2040-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm) or [RP2350-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-zero.htm) mini development board. The PCB is designed to fit in a 3D-printed case. PCB and Case design by [@DynaMight1124](https://github.com/DynaMight1124)
- Added new configuration to BoardConfigs.cmake and bld.sh to support the new configuration for this PCB. 

## 26/4/2025

- Releases now built with SDK 2.1.1
- Support added for Adafruit Metro RP2350 board. See README for more info. No RISCV support yet.
- Switched to SD card driver pico_fatfs from https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs. This is required for the Adafruit Metro RP2350. Thanks to [elehobica](https://github.com/elehobica/pico_fatfs) for helping making it work for the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo board.
- Besides FAT32, SD cards can now also be formatted as exFAT.
- Nes controller PIO code updated by [@ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). This fixes the NES controller issues on the Waveshare RP2040 - PiZero board. [#8](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/8)
- Board configs are moved to pico_shared.

## Fixes
- Fixed Pico 2 W: Led blinking causes screen flicker and ioctl timeouts [#2](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared/issues/2). Solved with in SDK 2.1.1
- WII classic controller: i2c bus instance (i2c0 / i2c1) not hardcoded anymore but configurable via CMakeLists.txt. 

## 19/01/2025

- To properly use the AliExpress SNES controller you need to press Y to enable the X-button. This is now documented in the README.md.
- Added support for additional controllers. See README for details.

## 01/01/2025

- Enabe fastscrolling in the menu, by holding up/down/left/right for 500 milliseconds, repeat delay is 40 milliseconds.
- bld.sh mow uses the amount of cores available on the system to speed up the build process.
- Temporary Rollback NesPad code for the WaveShare RP2040-PiZero only. Other configurations are not affected.
- Update time functions to return milliseconds and use uint64_t to return microseconds.

## 22/12/2024

- The menu now uses the entire screen resolution of 320x240 pixels. This makes a 40x30 char screen with 8x8 font possible instead of 32x29. This also fixes the menu not displaying correctly on Risc-v builds because of a not implemented assembly rendering routine in Risc-v.
- Updated NESPAD to have CLK idle HIGH instead of idle LOW. Thanks to [ManCloud](https://github.com/ManCloud). 
- Other minor changes.
